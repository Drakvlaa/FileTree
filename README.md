# FileTree
## FileTree is a C-based utility that recursively scans a specified directory to list all files and subdirectories. It navigates through each subdirectory, providing a comprehensive list of all files and their paths. This tool is useful for tasks such as directory analysis, file management, and creating inventories of file systems.
